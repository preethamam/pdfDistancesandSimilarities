# Introduction
Measures the distances and similarities between two probability density functions of signals. The distances and similarities presented in the paper **"Cha, Sung-Hyuk. Comprehensive survey on distance/similarity measures between probability density functions. City 1, no. 2 (2007): 1"** are implemented here. <br />

It is highly recommended to read the cited reference. Please note that some of the distances and similarities are NaN due to the division by zero and the log of zero. These cases deserve special attention.
